						JekQuest Project Completion - June 22nd
					</h2>
				</center>
				<p> 
					This is the first project I've tackled with a lot of support behind it. I've had the pleasure of multiple people helping me
					test and offer feedback the more I continued to work on it. I managed to create my own turn based RPG battle system,
					shaders, editors, etc all within the span of a few months. It was a great experience overall.
				</p>
				
				<p> 
					Some of the biggest hurdles during development was building the battle system from the ground up.
					I ran into a lot of issues with transitioning into battle, UI, enemy spawning, etc.
					Towards the end of development I was able to create a system that I could reuse and expand upon for future projects.
				</p>
				
				<p> 
					Another hurdle was creating my own assets. It took about a week or so to compose all the music for the game.
					Plus designing some of the attacks and making unique AI for some of the encounters. The final boss and credit sequence took a lot of time to make.
					I didn't get to implement all of the ideas I had intended but I feel pretty satisfied with what I was able to accomplish within the short time I set for myself.
				</p>
